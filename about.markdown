My name is Reece and I received my PhD in Cancer Biology from Stanford University. My work was on applying CRISPR activation screens towards understanding the genetic mechanisms that drive tumor sensitivity to CD8+ T cell killing. I am currently interested in transitioning into AI with applications in bio. If you know of any opportunities to help me with this transition, please shoot me an email or connect with me on LinkedIn.
